# Checkers
A Checkers Java program.

Currently, two users can play against each other. 
Users enter coordinates to move and coordinates to move to. 
The game checks for invalid moves and asks for move again.
If a jump exists for a player, the game makes the jump automatically.

An AI for the game is currently under production.
